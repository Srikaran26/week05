## Overview

Week 5 marks the transition from learning individual concepts to building cohesive, working systems. Each mini-project demonstrates key Java concepts like OOP, collections, file handling, and exception management in practice.

## Projects Covered

### Project 1: Bank Management System
- Use of inheritance, interfaces, and abstract classes
- Basic banking operations and account management

### Project 2: Student Grade Tracker
- File I/O to record student data
- Use of `Map` and `List` to organize and compute results

### Project 3: File Encryption/Decryption Tool
- Byte-level file processing
- Simple encryption logic using key shifting

### Project 4: E-commerce Price Tracker
- File parsing and comparison
- OOP principles and encapsulation

### Project 5: Address Book Management
- Add, update, delete, and search contacts
- Data persistence using serialization

## Tools and Technologies
- Java SE 8+
- File handling (`FileReader`, `FileWriter`, `ObjectStream`)
- Collections Framework
- Java Stream API

## How to Use This Repository
Each folder represents a different project. Open the folder, explore the code, and run the `main` class to see the output. Try enhancing the projects with your own ideas!
